 birthplace_of_anime_desc:0 "Akihabara is where anime-based culture first began to truly flourish outside of internet forums and blogs. Anime fans all over the world always had Akihabara close to their heart and revere it as a form of "pilgrimage site"; even after the Anomaly it continues to unite the people of Akiba and everyone who sympathizes with them."
 the_shock:0 "Anomaly: The Aftermath"

We need a capable government to take care of this situation and deal with the problem of our isolation, somehow."
