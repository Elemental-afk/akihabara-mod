akihabara.15.t:0 "First Contact"
akihabara.15.d:0 "Even though only a few days have passed since what apparently seems to be the fact that we've been transported into the twentieth century, our sudden appearance has already caused a lot of concern to the Imperial Japanese from the neigbouring 20th century Tokyo. They've quite obviously noticed the humongous buildings and modern technology that we've carried along with us. A squad of masked Japanese scouts has been sent by the Japanese in order to discover what we are, and what are our intents. How should we answer to their questions?"
akihabara.15.a:0 "You might not believe us, but we've come from the future..."
akihabara.15.b:0 "We could very well ask you the same question."
akihabara.15.c:0 "We are extraterrestial beings, coming from outer space."

akihabara.18.d:0 "The Council has decided that Akihabara is its own sovereign nation, answerable to no one. The fact that these Imperial Japanese have so rudely barged in without invitation is tantamount to trespassing. This will not be tolerated."
akihabara.18.a:0 "We'll protect our sacred land at all costs."

akihabara.19.t:0 "Imperial Japanese Visit"
akihabara.19.d:0 "Prime Minister Kōki Hirota has visited under the protection of Liutenant General Koichi Iwakoshi. The Liutenant General was very interested in the equipment of the JSDF regiments, while the Prime Minister was more interested in the various aspects of Otaku culture."
akihabara.19.a:0 "I see you're a man of culture as well."

akihabara.20.t:0 "The 2nd Imperial Japanese Visit"
akihabara.20.d:0 "Our policy of openness has attracted a great deal of attention from the Imperial Japanese. More and more are requesting to enter Akihabara, in an even grander visit this time."

akihabara.22.d:0 "The Imperial Japanese Army has requested formal permission to enter the city to search for their missing ambassador."
akihabara.22.a:0 "Let them in."
akihabara.22.b:0 "This smells like a trap, deny them access."

akihabara.23.t:0 "Sneak Attack!"
akihabara.23.d:0 "There was no lost ambassador after all! Once the Imperial Japanese Army entered the area, they overthrew the council of 100 and declared Martial Law!"
akihabara.23.a:0 "This is terrible!"

akihabara.24.t:0 "Military Seizes Control"
akihabara.24.d:0 "The remnants of the JSDF have managed to wrestle control back. Heavy urban fighting has broken out, and the former glow of the streets has been replaced with rubble and broken glass."
akihabara.24.a:0 "We're in control, at least for now."

akihabara.25.t:0 "Demands from the Imperial Army"
akihabara.25.d:0 "With the disappearance of the ambassador, the Imperial Japanese Army has assumed the worst, and issued a statement demanding we return him safely. The fact that we don't have him has fallen on deaf ears."
akihabara.25.a:0 "Damn."

akihabara.26.t:0 "Imperial Japanese Units Caught"
akihabara.26.d:0 "During Midnight, at roughly 2AM, some of our citzens, whom were returning to their temporary lodgings after watching anime, spotted and took photos of Imperial Japanese Infiltrators.\n\nUsing the flashes on thier smartphones, irrefutable evidence has been obtained.

akihabara.28.t:0 "WAR!"
akihabara.28.d:0 "This is and absolutely clear violation of our sovereignty! The council has deemed this as a just cause for our military retaliation."
akihabara.28.a:0 "We need support from the military first."
akihabara.28.b:0 "To war!"

akihabara.29.t:0 "Gain the Support of the JSDF"

akihabara.31.t:0 "The JSDF Refuses to Mobilize"
akihabara.31.d:0 "The JSDF has refused to support our war against the Imperial Japanese, remaining idle despite overwhelming evidence that they intend on invading us. We're unable to go to war without their support."
akihabara.31.a:0 "We'll have to settle for an apology then."

akihabara.32.t:0 "Apology Refused"
akihabara.32.d:0 "The Imperial Japanese have refused to apologize for 'walking into our backyard'. Already, zoom lenses on cameras and telescopes have witnessed the Imperial Japanese Army mobilizing to invade Akihabara."
akihabara.32.a:0 "Outrageous!"
akihabara.32.b:0 "Outrageous! Mobilize our troops!"

akihabara.33.t:0 "War Declared!"
akihabara.33.d:0 "The Imperial Japanese have declared war on us! While we've managed to beat them back initially, we cannot possibly win in a war of attrition, so we must win this war as fast as possible! First stop, the Imperial Palace!"
akihabara.33.a:0 "Banzai!"

akihabara.34.t:0 "Fall of the Imperial Palace"
akihabara.34.d:0 "We've managed to take the Imperial Palace. Brutal fighting occured as many Imperial Japanese units fought like men possessed. Only by expending large amounts of munition were we able to capture the Palace. The Emperor himself seems to have been evacuated."
akihabara.35.d:0 "We've captured the Imperial Palace! Despite initial resistance, our element of surprise proved to be capable, easily overwhelming them. Furthermore, the Emperor himself is now our hostage."
akihabara.34.a:0 "Next stop: Osaka!"
akihabara.35.a:0 "Let's negotiate with the Emperor."

akihabara.36.t:0 "Fall of Osaka"

akihabara.37.a:0 "Victory at last."

akihabara.38.t:0 "The Emperor Grants Amnesty"

akihabara.39.t:0 "The New Imperial Diet"
akihabara.39.d:0 "With the Emperor's blessing, the Imperial Diet was dissolved, and a new cabinet was formed. A few key figures from the Council of 100 has been appointed to key positions of power."

akihabara.40.d:0 "The Emperor has declared, in a public address to the entire nation, that Anime is the supreme culture. Amnesty has been granted to all units, and he hopes that the nation will quickly embrace Anime culture."
akihabara.40.a:0 "I see you're a man of culture as well."

akihabara.41.t:0 "Anime Reigns Supreme"
akihabara.41.d:0 "With the Emperor's blessing, a new government is formed, with the spreading of anime culture at its core. All throughout Japan, citizens are converting, and those who refuse are quickly branded Normies and ostracized."
akihabara.41.a:0 "Anime wasn't a mistake."

akihabara.42.t:0 "The Greater Council of 100"
akihabara.42.d:0 "With our victory secured, the council's power has expanded immensely. Leading a small town is a far different situation from leading an enture nation, and shakeups in the political situation are inevitable."
akihabara.42.a:0 "A masterstroke of diplomacy, regardless."

akihabara_economy.4.t:0 "Colonization Decision"
akihabara_economy.4.d:0 "Our newly developed colonial regions should now be available to receive our most important export of Anime. However, our resources are limited, so a decision must be made about which region to expand in."
akihabara_economy.4.a:0 "Korea!"
akihabara_economy.4.b:0 "Manchuria!"
 
akihabara_economy.5.t:0 "Contradictory Anime Practices"
akihabara_economy.5.d:0 "Our policy on anime in the workplace runs at odds to our economic policy. This has caused a significant amount of political turmoil, and we must suffer the consequences."
